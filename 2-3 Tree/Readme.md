# 2-3 Tree
>**TLDR:** ‚ÄúA **2‚Äì3 tree** is a **tree data structure**, where every **node** with **children** (internal node) has either two children (2-node) and one data element or three children (3-nodes) and two data elements. According to Knuth, ‚Äúa B-tree of order 3 is a 2‚Äì3 tree.‚Äù Nodes on the outside of the tree (leaf nodes) have no children and one or two data elements‚Äù

### Still hazy on what a 2-3 tree is or how / why it works?
** Insert shameless plug - ** I wrote a super [in depth article](https://medium.com/@alexdejeu/2-3-trees-9b50e3484a47) with fun gifs, illustrative pictures, and quality emoji use üîå üíØ  Definitely would recommend checking it out!


## Classes
```python
class Node(object):
  def __init__(self, *data, children=None, parent=None):  # ‚≠êÔ∏è Required
    pass

  def __str__(self):  # üî∑ Optional
    pass

  def add_data(self, value):  # ‚õë Helper
    pass

  def is_full(self):  # üî∑ Optional
    pass

    pass

```

```python

    pass
```

## Functions
#### Node
``init`` Going to want to store the nodes data, children, and parent.  May want to consider also having the ability to initialize with multiple pieces of data

``add_data(self, value)`` Insert a given value in the appropriate position and return that position

May want to consider - to write helpers for if the node is full, has space, is a leaf, or is an internal node ü§î

#### TwoThreeTree
``__init__`` May just want to initialize the root here, or maybe handle iterable data and add to the Tree from the start

``level_order_print(self, node)`` Might be useful to implement this function so you can visualize the tree.  **Hint** : Think about using a queue üéû

``find_node_value_belongs(self, value, node)`` Determine where a value belongs in a tree and return that node.

``split_node(self, node)`` Handle splitting a node when it is overfilled. Rather complicated --> Definitely recommend drawing it out or visualizing what it should be doing using this [awesome website](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BTree.html "Visualizing B-Trees").  Just make sure to handle all of those cases üòº

``insert(self, value)`` Definitely one of the core functions.  It will use split_node and find_node_value_belongs.  The general idea of inserting into a 2-3 tree is:

1Ô∏è‚É£ If the tree is empty, create a node and put value into the node

2Ô∏è‚É£ Otherwise find the leaf node where the value belongs

3Ô∏è‚É£ If the leaf node has only one value, put the new value into the node

4Ô∏è‚É£ If the lead node has more than two values, split the node and promote the median of the three values to parent

5Ô∏è‚É£ If the parent then has tree values, continue to split and promote, forming a new root node if necessary

``search(self, value)`` Very similar to searching through a binary search tree.  See if the data is in the current node otherwise determine which child of the current node *could* have the value being searched for and then move to that node.  Return True if it is found, otherwise return False.
