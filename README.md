# About
Awesome data structures implemented in Python that I made for my Medium articles.📚

The repo is divided into different folders containing specific data structures or topics.  Each folder *should* contain a link to the article the implementation is used in, starter code, solution code, and test case code.

Each folder will also contain a readme for relevant functions, expectations, and an outline if you want to try to code the data structure on your own! 🤘 Otherwise, there is starter code that will help walk you through implementing the class 🤗

At the end of the day you can think of each folder containing one topic with 3 levels of difficulty - the higher difficulty you complete the stronger you will understand the topic 😏

1️⃣ **Solution Code** - just look at the solution 🙄 Nice because you will see how it works and you likely can justify to yourself why it works, but you may not understand it fully 🙃

2️⃣ **Starter Code** - Great place to grow confidence, learn a ton, and work through the entire solution 🔥 No more blank py file intimidation.  Jump right in and fill in ```...``` with the right code.

 ```
# Example of starter code
if ... < ... : # Catch the edge case of there being less than 5 elements in data
  # Here you are going to want to update pointers
```

3️⃣ **From Scratch** - Yikes, this definitely will appear intimidating.  But you got this! 💪 Plus you will truly understand how and why everything works.  You will get to make design decisions and learn what works best and what can cause problems 😉 Further, to make it less intimidating, you get test code, and a nice readme with some solid suggestions of what methods and approaches might work well 😎  You got this!  Go get them 🦁
